Hello! I am a senior at **Colorado State University** pursuing a degree in **Ecosystem Science and Sustainability**. I am interested in pursuing **environmental law** especially as it pertains to **species conservation.**

I have experience:

-   Researching sea turtle conservation in Costa Rica

-   Working on environmental public outreach

-   Working as a barista at Dazbog Coffee

Outside of school and work, I enjoy reading and spending time with friends. Reading is an important way for me to expand my knowledge and learn new concepts outside of my field of study.
